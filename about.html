            <p>Mbayascollection ships anywhere in the United States, and to all US territories and military APO/FPO addresses.</p>
            <p>Just because shipping is free, doesn't mean it should take a long time. At check out, you will typically see multiple shipping options with estimated delivery dates, so you can pick the option that works best for you. Please note some items are ineligible for expedited shipping—such as watches containing lithium batteries—these items will be marked as such in the product description. Expedited shipping also is not available for shipments outside the continental United States; please allow additional time for your order to arrive to these locations. Orders to P.O. boxes, US territories or military APO/FPO addresses will ship via United States Postal Service (USPS). All delivery dates are subject to order cut-off times or carrier delays.</p>

Depending on your financial institution, please allow an additional 2–10 business days for the refund credit to post to your bank or credit card account.

            <h1>EXCHANGES</h1>
            <p>You also have the option to exchange an eligible item instead of returning it for a refund. Final Sale merchandise is sold as-is and is not eligible to exchange.</p>

            <h2>SELF-SERVICE EXCHANGES</h2>
            <p>You may be able to process a self-service exchange in your mbayascollection.com account—you will see this option in your account if an item is eligible to exchange via self-service. For self-service exchanges, you may only exchange one (1) item at a time from an order, and there may be up to a one (1) hour waiting period before you can request to exchange another item from that order. Our Customer Loyalty Team is subject to the same waiting period. If eligible, the replacement item will be shipped with next business day shipping free of charge. However, all items shipping to Alaska, Hawaii, P.O. Boxes, military address (APO, FPO), or US territories (e.g., Guam and Puerto Rico) will be sent via USPS and do not qualify for next business day shipping. Please note that for self-service exchanges, the replacement item can only be sent to the same shipping address used for the original order.</p>

            <h1>EXCHANGE PROCESSING</h1>
            <p>Our processing of exchanges entails a unique system for transferring funds because we want you to receive your new item as fast as possible. The funds from the original item being returned will be transferred to an e-Gift Card or an Exchange Voucher when the exchange is initiated. Mbayascollection will then apply the e-Gift Card or Exchange Voucher to the cost of the replacement item. You must return the original item in its original condition and original packaging within 14 days of the date of your exchange using the free return label provided to you. You will receive any refund owed to you once we receive the returned original item. If the original item is not received within 14 days, Mbayascollection will charge your original payment method or default payment method (if original method is unavailable) for the cost of the original item (less any refund owed to you if the replacement item costs less).</p>
            <p>If you later return the replacement item, a refund for that item (minus any shipping charges from the original order) will be issued to either: (a) an e-Gift Card if an e-Gift Card was applied to the exchange transaction, or (b) the original payment method if an Exchange Voucher was applied to the exchange transaction. The method of exchange by e-Gift Card or Exchange Voucher is determined by the Mbayascollection system and will be disclosed to you at the time that you request the exchange.</p>
            <p>As noted above in our return policy, it typically takes about 5-10 business days for your return to arrive at our fulfillment center for processing, and another 2-10 business days for the refund credit to post to your bank or credit card account.</p>
            <p>Questions? Contact us – the Mbayascollection Customer Loyalty Team is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year!</p>
